# Dataset

The dataset for this study consists of ten low-grade and ten 
high-grade brain tumor images, collected MEDISP ResearchLaboratory Archive of Biomedical Engineering Dept. at 
University of West Attica. Images were resized to a dimension 
of 96x96 pixels. Due to lack of large data set, data augmentation 
techniques were applied to artificially increase the size of the 
dataset, providing more diverse training samples.
