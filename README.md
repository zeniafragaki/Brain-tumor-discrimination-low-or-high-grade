 Statistical analysis of features able to discriminate between low and high grade brain tumor H&amp;E images

 This job is discussing the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for the classification of low- and high-grade brain tumor images. 
 Some of the most popular classifying algorithms were used to test the research case. Our case study has selected K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees, Random 
 Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost classifiers. Because of our limited dataset which contains 20 images (10 low and 10 high grade brain tumor), data augmentation techniques were used to achieve higher 
 statistic accuracy values. 
 Among our classifierâ€™s algorithms, Logistic Regression scored the best accuracy 83.33% with a data set of 50 images. Below will be presented more specifically the highlights of this study and possible future 
 corrections and adjustments for better results
