Machine learning and artificial intelligence last years has been 
widely used for medical and biological analysis, including 
tumor classification tools. Several studies have demonstrated 
the utility of ML algorithms for classification of different 
cancer types. Especially, in some projects Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures have been widely 
applied and used with 90.9% accuracy [5]. Also, previous 
works using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Discriminant 
Analysis (LDA), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with the 
Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) method have 
mentioned achieving accuracy 97.8%, distinguishing grade II 
glioma from metastasis. However, overall accuracy of this 
large-scale study is 84.7%.[6]. Additional works have shown 
over 90% classification accuracy in glioma grading and other 
tumor classification tasks [7].
